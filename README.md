# Oregon-Election-Calculator
A python program that calculates election results for the Oregon Country, based on the party inputted by the user, the ratings for each party on a scale of 1-10, and the party's perceived strength. Still a work in progress, see Read Me file.

Changes to be made
1. Link to a PostgreSQL database to replace the CSV file.
2. Addition of more states! (working on California + Nevada)
3. With the collection of more states, will add user option to pick which state they wish to calculate. The user choice will then filter the district information to the state of their choice.
4. Create a dictionary for major, minor, and 'tiny' party strength. Based on 0, 1, or 2 standard deviations from the left-wing or right-wing mean.
